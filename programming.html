        <h2>
          The first computer programming language was created in
          <strong>1883</strong>, when a woman named
          <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> worked with <u>Charles Babbage</u> on
          his very early mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. While
          Babbage was concerned with simply computing numbers, Lovelace saw that
          the numbers the computer worked with could represent something other
          than just amounts of things. She wrote an algorithm for the Analytical
          Engine that was the first of its kind. Because of her contribution,
          Lovelace is credited with creating the first computer programming
          language. As different needs have arisen and new devices have been
          created, many more languages have followed after her great achiviment but, she still the first  to achive that  goal .
