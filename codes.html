        <h2>what is coding?</h2>
        <h3>
          Coding is the process of transforming computer instructions into a
          form a computer can understand. Every website and app operates because
          programmers write code. However, you do not have to work in technology
          to use coding. In fact, job hunters can find most coding jobs outside
          of the tech industry. What can you do with coding? Learning to code
          serves as the foundation for lucrative career opportunities. Graduates
          of bootcamps may need to gain experience as junior developers before
          securing six-figure salaries
        </h3>
        <h2>How does coding work?</h2>
        <h3>
          All code tells a machine to perform a specific task. Whenever you use
          the Internet, your device uses binary code –– a sequence of "1s" and
          "0s" that tells your computer what switches to turn on or off. This
          serves as a reliable way to store data and process information. This
          process works quicker with high-level programming languages, such as
          Python, Java, and JavaScript. Each programming language serves a
          different purpose, but they all take code that reflects human speech
          and translate it into machine code, or a low-level language.
          Programmers and developers write instructions for computers using
          high-level programming languages.

        <h2>What are the benefits of coding?</h2>
        <h3>
          When bootcamps first opened in 2011, only tech junkies learned to
          code. Now industries outside of technology recognize the benefits of
          coding, and it's even taught at elementary schools –– from Alabama to
          Florida. Coding can teach important concepts applicable to a career in
          technology or to an entirely different field.
